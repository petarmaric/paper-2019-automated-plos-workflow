\section*{Abstract}

PLOS (the Public Library of Science) is a well known and respected publisher in the scientific community.
The process of publishing a paper in PLOS journals, while overall user-friendly, does come with some quirks and is quite particular about figures and manuscripts submitted in \LaTeX~format.
In essence, the act of writing a paper in \LaTeX~is currently divorced from the act of preparing it for submission, where the authors need to pay special attention when transitioning from one to the other; taking into account that some pre-submission preparation steps may be destructive to the original manuscript.
This leads to a non-trivial, manual and error prone process, that must be repeated again and again by each author wishing to contribute to PLOS journals.

This paper presents an automated workflow for writing and preparing \LaTeX~papers for submission in PLOS journals.
The benefits that paper authors and PLOS journals gain from the proposed automated workflow, over using the original PLOS \LaTeX~template directly, have been covered in sufficient detail.

This paper has itself been created using the proposed automated workflow, and it effectively serves as a practical example of the presented approach.
Both the proposed automated workflow and this paper have been published as Open Source Software.
